                <p>This is a web application dedicated to making your homebrewing experince seamless and fast!
                The features listed above are just the tip of the iceburg when it comes to making good coffee, but 
                essential to the process!</p>
                <p>This application is in development, and at the stage it's in looks like a mess. That being said pay no
                attention to styling (unless there's a blank page or something) and fully focus on functionality. Think 
                of questions like:</p>
                    <p>Does this make sense to me?</p>
                    <p>Is this button weird here?</p>
                    <p>Would this page look better like this?</p>
                    <p>Can I add items to this list?</p>
                    <p>Was it hard for me to navigate to this page?</p>

                <p>Some larger features wont be functioning and that's okay. Still let me know! if you think of any features
                that would be cool, note it. If you think of any features that are a waste of time, tell me!</p>
                
                
                <p>Thanks for testing the app. It helps to know what users are drawn to and click on. Speaking of
                clicks... Click on everything you can. If something weird happens, please note it.

                Cheers!</p>
